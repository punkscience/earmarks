     * Deletes the currently-playing earmark.
     *
     * UX contract: the UI advances IMMEDIATELY. All network work (Blossom
     * blob deletes, Nostr publish, cache cleanup) happens in a background
     * coroutine that never touches the page-level [AppState]. Background
     * failures surface via [_notice] as a dismissible dialog so the user
     * can get back to playback without restarting the app.
     *
     * Reliability contract: once blobs are deleted the Nostr list MUST
     * eventually lose the pointer. Three layered defenses:
     *
     *  1. **Sentinel first.** Before touching any blob we add the earmark's
     *     `ts` to [PendingPruneStore] (on-disk JSON in `filesDir`). If the
     *     process dies at any later step, [load] on next launch republishes
     *     the list with this entry removed.
     *  2. **Retry with backoff.** [publishWithRetry] calls `publishEarmarks`
     *     up to 5 times with exponential backoff (1s/2s/4s/8s/16s) and only
     *     considers publish successful on ≥1 relay ack.
     *  3. **NonCancellable / GlobalScope.** The post-blob phase runs under
     *     [NonCancellable] in [GlobalScope] so backgrounding the app can't
     *     tear down the publish coroutine before it succeeds or persists
     *     the sentinel for next-launch reconciliation.
     *
     * Ordering still matters for the contract: blobs first, then publish.
     * The UI change precedes both but is purely cosmetic — the sentinel is
     * what guarantees eventual convergence.
